**NotSoChaos** is a project that automatically updates its own code democratically. This means that anyone can easily add new features or edit existing ones.

## How it works
1. Fork the project and make changes to the code
2. Push the changes to your repository and [open a pull request](https://github.com/matmen/NotSoChaos/compare)
3. Wait for people to vote on your PR
4. If enough people voted for your PR, it will automatically be merged and the bot will update itself

## Voting
You can vote on a PR by going to its `Files changed` tab, clicking `Review changes` in the top right, and either choosing `Approve` (to vote for it) or `Request changes` (to vote against it)

## What does this do?
This is really up to you. Anyone can add, edit or remove features. There is no exact purpose.

## Server details
NotSoChaos runs on a Debian 9 server with access to [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org/) and [`Python 3.6`](https://www.python.org/), although more packages can be installed
